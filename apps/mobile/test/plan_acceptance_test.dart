/// Three properties, all of them about storage rather than about pixels:
///
/// * **Nothing in an accepted plan disappears.** A plan the farmer confirmed
///   is the farm's operational record from that moment on, and a record that
///   says "spinach" when the plan was mostly cabbage is worse than no record.
/// * **A replan replaces the schedule it supersedes**, which is what the
///   confirmation sheet promises in so many words.
/// * **The farmer's own reminders survive it**, because a task somebody typed
///   is not the planner's to delete.
