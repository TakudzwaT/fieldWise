/// Every method here is **local-first**. Reads are streams over local storage
/// so a screen renders from disk on its first frame and updates itself when a
/// record changes; writes land locally and return, queuing a mutation for a
/// later sync. Nothing on this interface waits on a network call, and no
/// implementation of it may make waiting on one possible — that is the whole
/// architectural point, not an optimisation.
///
/// This is separate from `FarmRepository` on purpose. That interface is the
/// `demo_api` contract — sessions, sections, the planner — and the demo API
/// has no observations, tasks or finance at all. Screens talk to this one.
