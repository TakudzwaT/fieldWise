/// The route table.
///
/// Routes follow guide §4 and are deep-linkable — a path is enough to reach a
/// screen, with no state to carry from the one before it. That is a property
/// of the architecture rather than a feature: every screen reads its own data
/// from local storage by id, so arriving cold and arriving by tap are the same
/// code path.
///
/// There is no `StatefulShellRoute`. The design's nav island floats *over*
/// content that scrolls beneath it, and Zone Detail is opened from Home with a
/// hero transition. Both want the screens in one navigator, so the shell is a
/// widget each screen wraps itself in rather than a route that wraps them.
