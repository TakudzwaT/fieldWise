/// fact about this install, not a farm record, and nothing about it is ever
/// synced. Uninstalling the app — or Maestro's `clearState` — removes it,
/// which is exactly when the journey should be shown again.
///
/// Every failure resolves towards Home. A launch that cannot tell whether the
/// intro was seen opens the farm, because the farm opening with no signal and
/// no login is the product's central promise, and the intro is not.
///
/// That is why this has its own [LaunchFile] rather than going through
/// `FileSessionStorage`: that one reads an unreadable or corrupt file as
/// "nothing there", which here would be a fresh install — and a phone whose
/// file cannot be read would then be shown the intro on every launch.
