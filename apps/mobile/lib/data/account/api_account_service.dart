/// The real [AccountService]: `/account/profile`, `/account/farm`,
/// `/account/export` and `DELETE /account`, through the session
/// [ApiAuthService] holds.
///
/// ## Offline edits
///
/// A change the farmer makes is written to the phone first, as a pending
/// edit, and only then sent. With no signal it stays pending — shown as such
/// — and goes out on the next launch or the next visit to Profile with one.
/// The record lives in secure storage under its own key (`almanac.account`),
/// because a profile is personal data even though it is not a credential.
///
/// ## Whose record this is
///
/// The record is stamped with the account it belongs to. If it was written
/// for someone else — a previous farmer on a shared phone whose sign-out did
/// not finish clearing it — it is discarded unread rather than shown to the
/// wrong person or sent under the wrong session.
///
/// Stamping the record is not enough on its own: an operation can start for
/// one account and finish after another has logged in. So every operation
/// captures the account and the session generation it began with (`_Op`),
/// every request it sends is refused once that generation moves, and every
/// write it makes is refused once either has changed.
