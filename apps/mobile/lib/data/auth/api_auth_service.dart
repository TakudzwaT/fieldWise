/// Passwords, codes and tokens. There is no `LogInterceptor` on this client,

///
/// ## Sessions and refresh
///
/// The backend issues an access token and a refresh token that share one
/// `expires_at`, thirty days out. Refreshing rotates both and starts a fresh
/// thirty days; once `expires_at` has passed, the refresh token is dead too.
/// So refreshing is something to do *early* — [refreshSession] extends the
/// session at the first opportunity with signal once it is past
/// [refreshWhenWithin] — because a farmer out of signal for a month cannot be
/// refreshed at all and has to log in again.
